# ROS 2 Manipulators — Exercises Workspace

A personal ROS 2 workspace collecting hands-on exercises and small experiments, with a main focus on **robot manipulators**.  
The goal is to keep a clean place to iterate on core concepts such as:

- **Robot description**: URDF/Xacro models, links/joints, frames, and basic visualization.
- **Motion / control basics**: simple trajectories or motion demos (e.g., “move in a pattern”), and quick test nodes.
- **Teleoperation & I/O**: minimal keyboard/command interfaces to drive test behaviors.
- **Simulation experiments**: occasional tests involving **Gazebo (gz)** and related tooling/bridges (when needed).

This repository is intended for learning and practice: packages may be independent, progressively improved, and not necessarily polished as a single “product”.

## Workspace layout
This repository is structured as a **standard ROS 2 workspace**, so you can build everything with `colcon` and source a single `install/`:

```text
<repo-root>/
├─ src/            # ROS 2 packages live here
│  ├─ <package_1>/
│  ├─ <package_2>/
│  └─ ...
├─ README.md
└─ (build/, install/, log/)   # generated by colcon (not committed)
